## What is this project?
This project involves a daily agenda application that displays the user's current schedule based on the present hour, providing an at-a-glance view of the user's activities for the specific time slot they are in.

## Features
The user can add notes that will persist on refresh by saving notes to local storage. The time blocks will turn different colors depended on the time of day, and the date at the top will always up up to date. 

## Technologies
I used JavaScript and jQuery for the logic, combined with HTML, Day.js for the time and data functionality, and CSS / Bootstrap for the front end design.
